    <p>
      Static data refers to <i>Shadow of the Weird Wizard</i>-specific
      information that is needed to create a character. This includes things
      like ancestries, paths, traditions, and spells. This tool does not ship
      with this data because it's not my data to distribute (it belongs to
      Robert J. Schwalb and <i>Schwalb Entertainment</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have zip file of the seed data, you can drop it off here. If you
      don't have one yet, you can create one if you have the{' '}

      and a bunch of time on your hands.
